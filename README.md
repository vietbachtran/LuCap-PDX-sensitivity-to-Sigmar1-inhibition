# LuCap PDX sensitivity to Sigmar1 inhibition

Sigmar1 is a multi-functional membrane scaffolding protein that are required for Prostate cancer progression. This project studies the novel drug-like compound, CT-1107, that inhibits Sigmar1. We have tested CT-1107 in LuCap prostate cancer patient derived xenografts (PDX) in mice. Some of the tested PDX models were sensitive to the drug and had slowed growth, while others were resistant to the drug. This project aims to find the differences in gene expression of PDX models that contribute to the sensitivity of the models to Sigmar1 inhibition. This project would reveal the potential biological pathways that the CT-1107 drug acts on in prostate tumors and give us a better understanding of Sigmar1's role in prostate cancer.

RNA sequencing data used in this project were extracted from the study GSE199596.
